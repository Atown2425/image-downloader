## Details

> Note:
> You can download this extension from 
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/leakgmkipjfnmnacgakpggmilnhlmbcg)
or
[releases](https://github.com/hatai/image-downloader/releases)

This project is forked from [image-downloader](https://github.com/vdsabev/image-downloader).
This includes several bug fixes.

If you need to bulk download images from a web page, with this extension you can:

* See images that the page contains and links to
* Filter them by width, height, and URL; supports wildcard and regex
* Optionally show only images from links
* Select images to download by clicking on the image
* Use dedicated buttons to download or open individual images in new tabs
* Customize image display width, columns, border size, and color
* Hide filters, buttons and notifications you don't need

## Known Issues

This extension can't always extract the full-resolution images that open when you click a photo (e.g. in Facebook albums). 
That's because the page doesn't directly link to the image, but uses a script. 
If you need that kind of functionality, there are other extensions that can be useful 
like Hover Zoom, even if you can't mass download images with it.
