* See images that the page contains and links to
* Filter them by width, height, and URL; supports wildcard and regex
* Optionally show only images from links
* Select images to download by clicking on the image
* Use dedicated buttons to download or open individual images in new tabs
* Customize image display width, columns, border size, and color
* Hide filters, buttons and notifications you don't need
